### Get Up & Running  

To run locally, clone the repo.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/beigebrucewayne/NgramShinyApp.git
```

Then, make sure you have R installed. The easiest way, if you have a Mac, is to use [homebrew](https://brew.sh/). Alternatively, you can always download from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/).
```bash
brew tap homebrew/science
brew install Caskroom/cask/xquartz
brew install r
```

Finally, start R in the project directory and invoke the Shiny library. You'll also need to install all of the libraries.

install.packages('shiny')
install.packages('tidytext')
install.packages('shinythemes')
install.packages('tidyverse')
install.packages('dt')
install.packages('wordcloud')

library(shiny)
shiny::runApp()
